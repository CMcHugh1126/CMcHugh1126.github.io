    <!-- Why It Matters Section -->
    <section class="card" aria-labelledby="why-title">
      <h2 id="why-title">Why does this matter?</h2>
      <p>
        Northern Virginia hosts one of the largest concentrations of data centers in the world. These facilities consume large amounds of electricity,
        strain power grids, and can drive infrastructure costs in the communties they are placed in. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of these facilities are built near marginalized communities that already face high housing costs, traffic, and environmental stress.
        Knowing how close you are to a data center allows you to better understand how they impact your neighborhood.

      <h2 id="justice-title">Data centers and environmental justice</h2>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li><strong>Energy burden:</strong> High electricity demand can require new transmission lines and grid upgrades which local taxes pay for.</li>
        <li><strong>Land use:</strong> Large facilities replace open land or older buildings and can change neighborhood character.</li>
        <li><strong>Unequal benefits:</strong> The jobs and profits may not go to the same people who live closest to the facilities and bear the impacts.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Tools like this can support conversations about fair zoning, environmental review, and ensuring that benefits are shared with nearby communities.
